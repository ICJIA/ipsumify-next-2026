# Code Search: Augment Context Engine

**Always use the Augment Context Engine MCP server** (`user-augment-context-engine`) for code searching and indexing.

## Tool to Use

- **Server**: `user-augment-context-engine`
- **Tool**: `codebase-retrieval`
- **Parameter**: `information_request` — a natural language description of the code you need

## When to Use

- When you don't know which files contain the information you need
- When gathering high-level information about a task
- When understanding the codebase in general
- Before making edits — ask for detailed information about the code you want to change

## Do NOT Use For

- Exact string matching (use Grep instead)
- Finding all references to a known identifier (use Grep instead)
- Reading a specific file you already know (use Read tool instead)

## Examples of Good Queries

- "Where is the function that handles user authentication?"
- "What tests are there for the login functionality?"
- "How is the database connected to the application?"
